# grafana_contactpoint [WIP]

* [contact point in Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/alerting/fundamentals/#contact-points)

Contact Points determine the notification message and where notifications are sent. 
For example, you might have a contact point that sends notifications to an email address, to Slack, to an incident management system (IRM) such as Grafana IRM or PagerDuty, or to a **webhook**.

1. Grafana Alerting periodically evaluates alert rules by executing their data source queries and checking their  conditions.
2. Each alert rule can produce multiple alert instances‚Ää-‚Ääone per time series or dimension
3. If a condition is breached, an alert instance fires.
4. Firing (and resolved) alert instances are sent for notifications, either directly to a contact point or through notification policies for more flexibility.


## Functionality/Needs:

* Routing phone calls (Routing in the PSTN or VoIP)
* Alert policies
* Manage on-call schedules
* Integrations with tooling (webhooks and stuff)
* Forwarding rules
* Licensing options

## Setup

* Setup webapp
```bash
# install dependencies
python -m venv .fastapivevn
source .fastapivevn/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Create `.env` file

```bash
cat<<EOF>.env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="INSERT_VALUE"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="INSERT_VALUE"
```
* Start docker containers

```bash
# start services and Build images before starting containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up --build -d
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml ps

# stop services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml down
```

üê±‚Äçüíª Grafana should be accessible on [localhost:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) and Prometheus on [localhost:9090](http://127.0.0.1:9090)

## Grafana config

* Get the web container name `docker ps --format "{{.Names}}"` and API key value `docker logs <container_name>`
* Create new contact point [here](http://127.0.0.1:3000/alerting/notifications/receivers/new) and 

## App

* At startup will generate an API key, used for auth, to be passed in the authorization header: Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>
* Get data from Grafana and send it to an sms gateway/Routing PSTN or VoIP (e.g. [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs))
